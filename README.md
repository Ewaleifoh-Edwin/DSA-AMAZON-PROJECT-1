# DSA-AMAZON-PROJECT-1
This is my real first Project after completing my Data Analysis Training with DSA

## AMAZON COMPANY

### COMPANY PROFILE
This is an e-commerce involved with online sales of different products.  They have diverse range of products like; Electronics, computers etc
They are involved in sales of diverse products like electronics, accessories, mobile phones etc

### Project overview
This project tends to find solutions to the troubling questions of the management team. The company wants me to help them analyse their products, customer reviews regarding their satisfaction in the products they purchased, which will give insight to how the products can be improved. Again, the company is wondering how they can push more products to the market having options to explore to achieve the goal such as discount percentages and at what time. Customers engagement is also very important as it helps the company to evaluate customers reaction to their products.

### Data Source
-Data was sourced from Amazon product pages.

-The company also provided more data from their record of Product category, price,discount,ratings/customer review etc.

### Tools Used
Microsoft Excel. Here i had to clean the data provided by the company and also generate more information from the limited data to be able to have more information to generate my pivot tables and as well the charts that will be on the Dashboard.

Creating more columns and inputting the formulars were not too challenging, except for the conditionals formulars that keep getting me stuck.
